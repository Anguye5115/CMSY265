# CMSY265

# Over the course of the semester, I developed a Java program that replicates a television retail store. I integrated fundamental data structures and algorithms: stacks, queues, linked structures, iterators, recursion, searching and sorting algorithms, trees, sets, maps, and graphs, in order to create an efficient console-based application. The project operates using file I/O and is dependent on the local workspace.
